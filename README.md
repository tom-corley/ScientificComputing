# Scientific Computing ðŸ§®

This repository contains a collection of C programs that simulate **partial differential equations (PDEs)** using a variety of **time discretisation methods**.

These projects were originally developed as part of a **Scientific Computing module** at the University of Warwick, each recieving marks of **95% and above**. All code is my original work. (To avoid copyright issues, the original coursework briefs are not included.)

## Assignments Breakdown

- A1: Basic C programs for number theory and sequences (Fibonacci, prime checking, etc.).
- A2: Array manipulation and algorithms (mirroring arrays, moving sums, range counting).
- A3: Debugging assignment on PDE solver, with detailed error tracking and code corrections.
- A4: Implicit solvers for coupled diffusion equation using banded matrices and LAPACK routines, includes various gifs showing evolution of PDEs.
- A5: Solution of a modified heat equation over curved surfaces. Includes a Python Jupyter notebook for data processing and plotting results.
